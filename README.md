## Part A: Understanding the App.

**What problem does the app solve?**
<br> Before WhatsApp, communication especially international and long-distance relied heavily on SMS and traditional phone calls, 
which were often expensive and unreliable. WhatsApp was developed to address this problem by enabling real-time messaging and calling 
over the internet. This allows users to communicate instantly, securely, and at a low cost, regardless of their geographic location.

**Who are its primary users?**
<br>WhatsApp serves a wide range of users, including:
1. Students and young people for everyday communication

2. Families and friends staying connected across long distances

3. Small and medium-sized businesses communicating with customers and promoting products

4. Community and social groups coordinating activities and sharing information

**2. Core Features**
<br>The key features of WhatsApp include:

- **User Authentication & Login:**
Account creation and login using verified phone numbers

- **Messaging:**
Sending and receiving text messages, images, videos, and voice notes

- **Voice and Video Calls:**

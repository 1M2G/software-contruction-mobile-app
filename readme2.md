# Understanding Software Construction and Collaboration  
**Group Assignment**

## 1. The difference between programming and software construction.

**Programming:**  
A developer writes code to calculate account balances, how to make a transaction, and how to recognize valid PINs. Each piece of code gives the computer clear instructions on what to do.

**Software Construction:**  
The team brings together the login system, transaction features, database, security checks, and user interface to create a complete mobile banking app that customers can actually use.

**Difference:**  
Programming focuses on writing instructions, while software construction focuses on assembling all parts into a working banking system.

## 2. A situation where poor maintainability causes problems

**Scenario:**  
While building any system, one may encounter bugs and these need frequent fixes.

**Problem caused by poor maintainability:**  
- No clear structure to isolate bugs  
- Fixing one bug introduces two new ones  
- No tests to confirm fixes  

**Serious impact:**  
The project becomes unstable, and more time is spent fixing bugs than building new features.

## 3. Version control in team based software development

Version control, commonly done using tools like Git with platforms such as GitHub, helps teams track and manage changes made to the code. It allows multiple developers to work on the same project at the same time without overwriting each other’s work.

If a mistake happens, the team can easily return to a previous stable version of the software.

Version control also supports feature branches, making it easier to develop, test, and merge changes safely.

## 4. How code reviews improve both software quality and development skills.

Code reviews improve software quality by catching bugs, improving readability, and enforcing good coding practices before the code reaches users. They also help developers learn better ways to solve problems by receiving feedback and seeing how others write code.

Over time, this shared learning raises both the reliability of the software and the skill level of the team.

## 5. How AI can help in understanding code without replacing learning.

AI can help developers understand code by explaining logic, suggesting improvements, and pointing out possible errors, which makes learning faster and clearer. It acts like a guide or tutor, not a replacement, because developers still need to think, decide, and write solutions themselves.

Using AI alongside practice helps programmers understand why code works, not just copy it. In this way, AI supports learning and productivity without removing the need for human skills and judgment.
